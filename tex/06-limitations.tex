\section{Limitations} \label{sec:sec5}

Our partition algorithm performance experiment bears several limitations.

First, the dataset used in the experiment is retrieved from the SNAP project page, which represents a small portion of the social network starting from one node and traverse through all of its neighbours. Even the combination of several networks cannot form a real social network. A real social network map may consist of many isolated nodes due to inactive accounts. 

Second, unlike large networking sites, small companies' user social network may not exhibit some features such as the community structure among the users. An example is that a mobile online game application company may provide social networking services where the player can make friends in the game. However, the player-to-player interaction is limited to between two players rather than in a group, so that one would like to make friends with someone he or she does not know and all his friends do not know each other. Therefore, the overall network map will be sparse and even distributed among all the nodes. In this case it is difficult to find a community structure in the networks. In our experiment, the dataset is retrieved from Facebook, DBLP, and YouTube, it may be favourable for some algorithms while make others in disadvantages; as a result, DBLP and YouTube data is labeled as network containing ground-truth communities.

Finally, our experiment only considers to store one copy of the user profile into the server. It is plausible since we are focusing on small business, where the availability of networking services may not be a key issue. However, in the real world, some of the companies would like to store the data in several copies. The difference in the number of replication will affect the performance results, for some of the overhead of an algorithm may be considered as a replication stored in a different server. Therefore, the overall overhead decreases when more replication are needed. Future works may take the replication into consideration and get a better performance comparison.
