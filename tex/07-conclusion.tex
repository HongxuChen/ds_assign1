\section{Conclusion}

In this project, we examined the performance of different partitioning algorithm for storing the social network of the small companies. The experiment has shown that xx has the best performance over other algorithms with least overhead generated in partitioning the testing data. Based on the experiment result, we suggests that small companies which running social networking services could implement the xx to partition the user nodes. In addition, the experiment has shown that simple algorithm like the random partition algorithm will achieve about $99\%$ of the performance of advanced algorithm. For some companies whose resource is limited, they can opt to choose the simple algorithm by sacrificing little performance. In future work, to further improve the accuracy of the analysis, it is suggested that one can use real world small companies data, if possible, to perform the testing; and find the best algorithm that suit the business.
