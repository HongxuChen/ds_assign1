\section{Conclusion}

In this project, we examined the locality results of a few partitioning algorithms for an existing static network. The experiment has shown that community detection partition achieves the best locality while random partitioning approach has the least computation overhead. If the underlying network is infrequently changed or its size is relatively small, we suggest implementing the METIS algorithm since it leverages the computation and the data locality well. For some companies whose resource is limited, they can opt to choose to combine the random partitioning approach with replication, or some caching mechanisms. Our work also provides a reference for these companies to evaluate the partitioning approaches by themselves.
