\section{Introduction}

Social media has gained its popularity over the years. According to Pew research center [2], $74\%$ of all the Internet users has used the social network site and the number keeps increasing. 

Due to the need from the customers, in recent years, many startup companies begin to develop their business in this area. Based on the report of Gust [1], a company aims to build the connection build startup and inserts, in 2015 second quarter, the number of startup has increased by $20\%$ compared to the same time in 2014 and $26\%$ for the first quarter of 2015. Among all the startups, $13\%$ of them mainly focus on providing Internet web services and others, like entertainment applications startups may also involve social networking functionalities. 

One of the problems in developing software with social network capability is to divide the user data into groups and store them into different server. A good way of storing the data will improve the availability by providing replication of the data into different server and the scalability by maintaining the data locality within the server. Many researchers have developed various complexed partition algorithms to improve the performance of the large social networking site. However, few of them have optimized their solution to suit the case where a relatively small network is presented and little resource is available. Therefore, this study is going to evaluate different partition algorithmâ€™s performance for the small startup companies.
